# CJ-AI — Cybersecurity AI Assistant

A terminal-based AI assistant specialized exclusively in cybersecurity and information security. Built with Python, designed to run on Linux and Termux.

---

## Features

- Conversational Q&A on all major cybersecurity topics.
- Structured command reference for Linux/security tools (Nmap, Wireshark, Hashcat, SSH, etc.).
- Fuzzy search through the knowledge base using RapidFuzz — handles typos and rephrasing.
- Out-of-scope detection — politely refuses questions unrelated to security.
- Full conversation logging to a local SQLite database.
- Unanswered question tracking for future knowledge base improvement.
- Bilingual support: English and Arabic.
- Rich terminal UI with color-coded output.

## Database Schema

The SQLite database (`database/chat_history.db`) contains four tables:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `users` | User records (username, created_at) |
| `messages` | All conversation messages (role, content, timestamp) |
| `unanswered` | Questions CJ-AI couldn't answer — for developer review |
| `logs` | System log entries |

---

## Adding Knowledge

### Method 1 — Edit knowledge.json directly

Open `knowledge/knowledge.json` and add a new entry to the `entries` array:

```json
{
  "id": 999,
  "question": "What is a replay attack?",
  "answer": "A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts and retransmits valid data...",
  "tags": ["replay attack", "network security", "authentication"]
}
```

Make sure the `id` is unique. Restart CJ-AI for the change to take effect.

### Method 2 — Use the knowledge_loader API (programmatic)

```python
from core.knowledge_loader import append_entry
from config import KNOWLEDGE_FILE

append_entry(
    path=KNOWLEDGE_FILE,
    question="What is a replay attack?",
    answer="A replay attack occurs when...",
    tags=["replay attack", "network security"]
)
```

### Reviewing Unanswered Questions

Questions that CJ-AI couldn't answer are stored in the `unanswered` table. To review them:

```python
from database.database import Database
from config import DB_FILE

db = Database(DB_FILE)
db.initialize()
for row in db.get_unreviewed():
    print(row["id"], row["question"])
```

Once you've added an answer to the knowledge base, mark the entry as reviewed:

```python
db.mark_reviewed(question_id=5)
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Install pytest if needed
pip install pytest

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

---

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `rapidfuzz` | Fuzzy string matching for knowledge base search |
| `rich` | Terminal styling and colored output |

Both are standard Python packages, compatible with Linux and Termux.

## Design Principles

- No offensive capabilities — CJ-AI is purely educational and defensive.
- No automatic learning from user input — all knowledge additions require developer review.
- No external API calls — fully offline operation.
- Modular architecture — each component has a single responsibility.
- Easy to extend — add topics by editing one JSON file.
